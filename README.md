Applied Data Science for Covid19 Data Visualization
==============================

Applied data science on Covid19 data

The goal of this project is to learn the best practices of data science from the industry while developing a COVID-19 analysis prototype, to trace the confirmed number, calculate the doubling rate and doubling time for 100+ countries and also to generate SIR model simulation.

The final result will be a dynamic dashboard - which can be updated by one click - of COVID-19 data with filtered and calculated data sets like the current Doubling Rate of confirmed cases.

Techniques used are REST Services, Python Pandas, scikit-learn, Facebook Prophet, Plotly, Dash.

For this, I have followed an industry-standard process (CRISP-DM) by focusing on the iterative nature of agile development

* Business understanding (what is our goal)
* Data Understanding (where do we get data and cleaning of data)
* Data Preparation (data transformation and visualization)
* Modeling (Statistics, Machine Learning, and SIR Simulations on COVID Data)
* Deployment (how to deliver results, dynamic dashboards in python)
* The entire project follows the development flow of a rapid prototype project
